// any normal test will be displayed at

//
// Lines with '!' at the beginning will be questions
//displayed like this:
// <a>
//
// 1) <b>
//
// 2) <c>
//
// 3) <d>
//
// ect...
// Here's the syntax:
//!a=b-c-d=index:0 
//after the '=' you can add as many sections as you
//want!
//'=index:' is a decorator. In the main file it 
//should always be 0.
//When you set it to one it will skip the next .txt file.
//If you have one question that points to 5.txt,
//and another question that also points to 5.txt,
//you can set the index to 1 so that the 
//question you have just made points to the next few 
//text files and skips 5.txt.
